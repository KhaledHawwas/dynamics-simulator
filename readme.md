# Description
This app allows users to calculate and visualize the motion of objects in vertical launch scenarios. 
By providing any two of key variables, the app will calculate the remaining variables and simulate the motion.

## Key Variables
The simulator works with the following physics variables:  
- **Vi**: Initial velocity (m/s)  
- **Height0**: Initial height (m)  
- **MaxHeight**: Maximum height reached (m)  
- **Vf**: Final velocity (m/s)  
- **EndTime**: Total time until the object returns to the ground (s)  


## Features
- **Calculate missing variables**: Automatically compute missing values when at least three variables are provided.  
- **Visualize vertical motion**: Simulate and display the motion in real-time.  
- **Interactive adjustments**: Modify simulation parameters dynamically.
